Netflix is the leading Internet television network and the most valuable and largest streaming service in the world, with over 139 million paid subscribers (total viewer pool: 300 million) across 190 countries, 15,400 titles across its regional libraries, and 112 Emmy Award nominations in 2018. The success behind the amazing story of Netflix is incomplete without the mention of its recommender systems, which focus on personalization according to users. According to your preferences, there are several methods to create a list of recommendations. You can use collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for recommendations.

Netflix's recommendation system provides them with an idea of the popularity of their services by increasing the number of subscriptions sold, which offers a variety of items for selection, which increases user satisfaction, loyalty to the platform, and provides them with a better understanding of what the user wants.Then itâ€™s easier to get the user to make better decisions from a wide variety of movie products.

After performing exploratory data analysis on the cleaned and prepared data, valuable insights were gained. The analysis revealed that the majority of content on Netflix falls under either the TV-MA or TV-14 rating categories. Notably, the United States and India emerged as the top two countries contributing the most content to the platform. Genres such as documentaries and stand-up comedy stand out with a significant number of titles available. Additionally, it was observed that movies outnumber TV shows in the Netflix library. The correlation heatmap indicated that in India, a substantial number of teenagers engage with Netflix content. The subsequent step involved creating an unsupervised clustering model, beginning with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduced the number of components to seven while retaining approximately 99% of the variance. Utilizing both the elbow method and silhouette score, it was determined that k = 4 was the optimal value for K-means clustering. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering, visualized through a dendrogram, reaffirmed k = 4 as the most suitable choice for clustering. These findings allowed us to successfully achieve the project's objectives.
